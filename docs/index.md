# InvenTree Project Documentation

These pages contain general information regarding the direction and governance of the InvenTree project. They target the general org, not only InvenTree/InvenTree, the inventory management system.

InvenTree consists of many components, working together to enable inventory management and more, with a focus on electronics (manufacturing). Decisions regarding the architecture of the project are documented in the [ADR](adr/index.md) directory.

## Ecosystem

Due to its plugin interface, InvenTree is being extended by multiple parties.
These pages govern all components created, maintained and releases by the InvenTree organization. Other actors in the ecosystem are **encouraged** to participate in the creation and lifecycle-ing of ADRs, but these pages do not govern them.

There is **no penalty** mechanism for not following these guidelines in principle. Non-compliant components might however, not work and might not receive attention.
