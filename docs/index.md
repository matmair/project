# InvenTree Project Documentation

These pages contain general information regarding the direction and governance of the InvenTree project. They target the general org, not only InvenTree/InvenTree, the inventory management system.

InvenTree consists of many components, working together to enable inventory management and more with a focus on electronics (manufacturing). Decisions regarding the architecture of the project are documented in the [ADR](adr/index.md) directory.

## Ecosystem

Due to its plugin interface, InvenTree is being extended by mutltiple parties.
These pages govern all components created, miantained and releases by the InvenTree organization. Other actors in the ecosystem are **encouraged** to participate in the creation and lifecycleing of ADRs but they are not governed by these pages.

There is **no penalty** mechanism for not following these guidelines in principal. Non-compliant components might however not work and might not receive attention.
